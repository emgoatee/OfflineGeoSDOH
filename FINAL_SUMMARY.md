# OfflineGeoLocator - Project Complete! 🎉

## What We Built

A fully offline geocoding application with Mac installer that's easy for anyone to use.

## How It Works

### For Users:

**Step 1: Install (ONE TIME - requires internet)**
- Download `OfflineGeoLocator-Installer-v1.0.1.pkg` (174MB)
- Double-click to install
- Installs to Applications folder

**Step 2: First Launch (ONE TIME - requires internet)**
- Launch app from Applications
- Dialog explains state download needed
- Terminal opens with guided state downloader
- User selects which states they need
- States download automatically
- Browser opens to app

**Step 3: Use Forever (100% OFFLINE)**
- Launch app anytime (no internet needed)
- Enter addresses
- Get health index data
- Everything runs locally on their Mac

### Offline Capabilities:
✅ Geocoding (address → coordinates) - Offline
✅ Census tract lookup - Offline
✅ Health index retrieval (SDI, SVI, ADI, etc.) - Offline
✅ Web interface - Offline (localhost)
✅ All computations - Offline

❌ Initial installer download - Requires internet
❌ Initial state package download - Requires internet

**After setup: Works anywhere, anytime, no internet needed!**

## Project Files Ready

### On Your Computer:

**Installer Package:**
```
/Users/tom6nz/Desktop/OfflineGeoLocator/OfflineGeoLocator-Installer-v1.0.1.pkg
Size: 174MB
```

**State Packages:**
```
/Users/tom6nz/Desktop/OfflineGeoLocator/state_packages/
Files: 57 packages (core_data.zip + 56 states)
Total: 3.2GB
```

### On GitHub:

**Repository:** https://github.com/emgoatee/OfflineGeoSDOH
- ✅ All code pushed
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Tag v1.0.1 created
- ⏳ Release not yet published (waiting for you)

---

## What To Do Next

### 1. Create GitHub Release (5-10 minutes)

**Go to:** https://github.com/emgoatee/OfflineGeoSDOH/releases/new?tag=v1.0.1

**Fill in:**
- Title: `v1.0.1 - Mac Installer Package`
- Description: Copy from `RELEASE_NOTES.md`

**Upload files:**
- `OfflineGeoLocator-Installer-v1.0.1.pkg` (174MB) ← Main file
- `state_packages/core_data.zip` (112MB) ← Required
- All `state_packages/state_*.zip` files ← Optional

**Publish the release**

### 2. Share With Users

Send them this link:
```
https://github.com/emgoatee/OfflineGeoSDOH/releases/latest
```

Tell them:
> "Download the .pkg file, double-click to install, and follow the guided setup. After downloading states once, it works completely offline!"

### 3. Optional: Test First

Before publishing release, you can test the installer:
1. Double-click `OfflineGeoLocator-Installer-v1.0.1.pkg`
2. Install to Applications
3. Launch and verify it works
4. Then upload to GitHub

## Size Comparison

| What | Size | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Original Monolithic** | 3.1GB | Everything in one file |
| **New Installer** | 174MB | Core app only |
| **Core Data** | 112MB | Required CSV files |
| **Minimum Setup** | 286MB | Installer + core data |
| **With 1 State (OH)** | ~310MB | Small state |
| **With 1 State (CA)** | ~487MB | Large state |
| **All States** | 3.4GB | Complete setup |

**Users save bandwidth by only downloading what they need!**
