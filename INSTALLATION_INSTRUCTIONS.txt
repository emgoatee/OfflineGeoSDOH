OfflineGeoLocator Installation Instructions
============================================

IMPORTANT: macOS Security Notice
---------------------------------

When you first open the installer, macOS may show a warning:
"OfflineGeoLocator-Installer-v1.0.1.pkg cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."

This is normal! The app is safe, but it's not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate.

HOW TO INSTALL:
---------------

Option 1 (Easiest):
1. Right-click (or Control+click) on the .pkg file
2. Select "Open" from the menu
3. Click "Open" in the dialog that appears
4. Follow the installation prompts

Option 2:
1. Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy
2. Click the lock icon to make changes
3. Try opening the .pkg file again
4. Look for a message about the blocked installer
5. Click "Open Anyway"

After Installation:
-------------------
1. Find OfflineGeoLocator in your Applications folder
2. Right-click → Open (first time only)
3. Follow the guided setup to download state data
4. Browser will open automatically
5. Start geocoding addresses!

Why This Happens:
-----------------
macOS requires apps to be signed with an Apple Developer certificate ($99/year).
This free app isn't signed, so macOS shows a security warning.

The app is open-source and safe to use:
