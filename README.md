# OfflineGeoLocator

A Flask web application that performs offline geocoding of US addresses and retrieves multiple Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) indices.

## Features

- **Offline Geocoding**: Convert US street addresses to coordinates using Census TIGER/Line shapefiles
- **Multiple Health Indices**: Retrieve SDI, SVI, ADI, Brokamp ADI, and COI data
- **Modular State Packages**: Download only the states you need (~200-500MB each)
- **All 50 States + Territories**: Supports all US states and territories
- **Standalone Application**: Packaged as executable for Mac and Windows

## Development

### Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5001

### Building Executables

#### Local Build

```bash
# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Build executable
pyinstaller OfflineGeoLocator.spec
```

The executable will be in the `dist/` directory.

#### Automated Builds with GitHub Actions

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically build executables for both Mac and Windows.

**To trigger a build:**

1. **Push a version tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Or manually trigger:**
   - Go to GitHub Actions tab
   - Select "Build Executables" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"

**Built executables will be:**
- Attached as artifacts to the workflow run (available for 90 days)
- Attached to the GitHub Release (if triggered by a tag)

## Handling Large Data Files (11GB)

The `data/` folder contains 11GB of Census TIGER/Line shapefiles and is excluded from git. You have several options:

### Option 1: Git LFS (Recommended for GitHub)

```bash
# Install Git LFS
# macOS: brew install git-lfs
# Windows: Download from https://git-lfs.github.com

# Initialize Git LFS
git lfs install

# Track the data folder
git lfs track "data/**"
git add .gitattributes
git add data/
git commit -m "Add data files with Git LFS"
git push
```

**Note:** GitHub has LFS storage limits. Free accounts get 1GB storage/month bandwidth.

### Option 2: External Hosting

Upload the `data/` folder to:
- AWS S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- Dropbox/Google Drive

Then update the GitHub Actions workflow to download it during builds.

### Option 3: Manual Distribution

1. Build locally (since you have the data folder)
2. Manually upload executables to GitHub Releases
3. Share download links with users

## Application Structure

- `app.py` - Main Flask application with geocoding logic
- `templates/index.html` - Web interface
- `data/` - Census shapefiles and health index data (11GB)
- `OfflineGeoLocator.spec` - PyInstaller configuration
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow

## For Users

### Installation

1. **Download the Core App**
   - Download `OfflineGeoLocator-Core-macOS.zip` or `OfflineGeoLocator-Core-Windows.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/emgoatee/OfflineGeoSDOH/releases)
   - Extract the ZIP file

2. **Download State Packages**
   - Download state packages for the states you need (e.g., `state_OH.zip`, `state_CA.zip`)
   - Extract state ZIP files into the `data/` folder next to the executable

   **OR** use the built-in downloader:
   ```bash
   # Run the state downloader utility
   python download_states.py

   # Follow the interactive prompts to download states
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   - Double-click the executable or run it from terminal
   - Open http://localhost:5001 in your web browser
   - Enter a US address to get health index data

### File Sizes

- **Core App**: ~200-500 MB (includes all health index CSV data, no state shapefiles)
- **Each State Package**: ~200-500 MB (varies by state population density)
- **Example**: Core + Ohio + Pennsylvania + New York â‰ˆ 1.5-2 GB total

This modular approach means you don't need to download all 11GB of data - just download the states you actually use!
